S3 data is not encrypted at rest - data should be encrypted on the server side as it is transparent to the AWS user and requires no extra effort
S3 buckets should have all `block public access` options enabled - since the bucket is not holding a web application, it should have all access restricted only to the specific IAM roles for the instance
S3 bucket policies should only allow requests that use HTTPS
The policy InstanceRolePolicy-C3 allows access to all buckets and permits all operations on them. This conflicts with the least priviledge principle.
WebAppSG allows incoming and outgoing traffic to port 22 which shouldn't be opened. Access to instances should be provisioned through AWS session manager or not provide access at all.
VPC security group rules should not permit ingress from '0.0.0.0/0' to TCP/UDP port 22 (SSH) - access should be restricted to one ip
S3 access should be limited to priviledged business users and WebAppSG
