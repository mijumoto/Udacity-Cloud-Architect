Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an SSH brute force attack from the internet.

- Instance level: disable the ssh service
- Instance level: restrict ssh failed attempts to 3 failures, this can be done in the configuration for ssh
- Instance level: disable ssh password and use a key file to log in
- Security group: block ingress/egress traffic to port 22
- Only allow access to port 22 from certain ips (developer machines, bastion host, etc..)

Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket; even in the instance that API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data?

- Setup a user managed key for encrypting the bucket data, this way even if an attacker has access they wont be able to do anything with it.
- Restricting access to the bucket only to the priviledge user roles
