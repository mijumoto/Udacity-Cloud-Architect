What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet-facing attack surface of the web application instance.

- Add a WAF in front of the load balancer

Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

- The bucket will still be accessible through the attacker machine since it is located inside the VPC.

Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

- No, only objects uploaded, modified, or copied will be encrypted

The changes you made above were done through the console or CLI; describe the outcome if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment?

- If the cloudformation template is applied again, most of the changes will return to their original state. Except for the changes to the EC2 instance.
